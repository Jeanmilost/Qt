# Dynamic pages
This project shows how to dynamically add and remove children components onto a view, by using a `ListModel`, associated with a `Repeater` in a `StackLayout` view.

There is no limit about how many child may be added, and any child may be deleted, whatever its position in the view.

The purpose of this demo was to create a prototype of dynamic loading system, with the best possible memory management, and to take advantage of the qml components to perform the work, instead of writing explicitly the code to add and remove the children components on the view.
