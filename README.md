# Qt
This repository contains several demos and prototypes based on the Qt and Qml API.

## Connect flow interface
This project shows a connect flow interface, on which you can put box components, which may be connected with links, in a similar way as e.g what is done in the Unreal blueprint system.

This interface was originally created for the Simple Path application project, see:
https://github.com/thesimplepath/The-Simple-Path
