# Qt
This repository contains several Qt and Qml demos and prototypes I created for several of my personal projects.

## Connect flow interface
This project shows a connect flow interface, on which you can put box components, which may be connected with links, in a similar way as e.g what is done in the Unreal blueprint system.

## Dynamic pages
This project shows how to dynamically add and remove children components onto a view, by using a `ListModel`, associated with a `Repeater` in a `StackLayout` view.
